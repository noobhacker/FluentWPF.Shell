Tried my best to match the margins from Windows 10 settings.

Usage: Modify items in MainViewModel. 
This uses FluentWPF Alpha for strong blur effect: https://github.com/sourcechord/FluentWPF/releases/tag/0.10.0-alpha001

Challenges: I tried to encapsulate this as a library but it couldn't find ButtonRevealStyle.
