# FluentWPF.Shell

The main navigation frame that looks like Windows 10 settings.

![Alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16358189/126350120-93b4dcc9-2eda-482a-aa93-20d7ae6284fb.gif "gif")

Tried my best to match the margins from Windows 10 settings.

Usage: Modify items in MainViewModel. 
This uses FluentWPF Alpha for strong blur effect: https://github.com/sourcechord/FluentWPF/releases/tag/0.10.0-alpha001

Challenges: I tried to encapsulate this as a library but it couldn't find ButtonRevealStyle.
